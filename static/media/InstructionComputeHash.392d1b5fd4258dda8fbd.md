### Step 5: Compute Hash
Click on the 'Compute Hashes' button.  Go to the 'Hashed Data' tab to view the results.  Verify that the personal identifier columns have been replaced by the computed hash.  Also verify that the participant ID column is correct.

Once the results are verified, click on the download icon to download the resulting hashes.  Submit the hashed spreadsheet through the data deposit form.

Columns that need to be hashed are sorted alphabetically by column name, trimmed of whitespaces, and concatenated together.  It is important that on subsequent submissions of the mapping file, users use the same column names for the personal identifier fields. This will ensure that the hashes are reproduceable and we are not generating new hashes for the same Participant ID.
