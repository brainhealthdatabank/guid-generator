# GUID Generator Utility

## About
In order to submit files to the repository, teams will need to provide a participant mapping file.  Rather than provide PI information, this tool allows teams to generate a hash value based on a combination of fields in the excel file.  Once the hash is created, then teams can download the participantID-hash value mapping and submit that file.

The hash value will be hashed once more before it is stored in our database.
